ðŸš¦ One-liner memory trick:
int *a = &a;

int *a â†’ a signpost pointing to a house
*a â†’ enter the house to see the value
&a â†’ find the house address

# Understanding `*` in C

The `*` symbol in C can be confusing for beginners because it has **different meanings depending on where it is used**.
This guide breaks it down with clear examples.

---

## 1. `*` as a Pointer Declaration

- **Syntax:**
  ```c
  typename *pointer_variable;
  ```
Purpose: Declares a variable that will store the memory address of another variable.
Example:
    ```c
    int *ptr;   // ptr is a pointer to an integer
    int x = 42;
    ptr = &x;   // store the address of x in ptr
    ```

## 2. * as a Dereference Operator
Syntax:
*pointer_variable
Purpose: Access the value stored at the memory address held by the pointer.
Example:
int x = 42;
int *ptr = &x;

printf("%d\n", *ptr);  // prints 42
*ptr = 99;             // changes the value of x to 99
ðŸ“Œ Think of it like:
ptr â†’ "the address of x"
*ptr â†’ "the value at that address"
## 3. * as a Multiplication Operator
Syntax:
operand1 * operand2
Purpose: Performs multiplication between two numbers.
Example:
int product = 5 * 3;  // product = 15
## 4. * in Multi-line Comments
Syntax:
/* This is
   a multi-line
   comment */
Purpose: To enclose comments spanning multiple lines.
The compiler ignores everything inside /* ... */.
## 5. * in printf with Dynamic Width
Syntax:
printf("%*d", width, value);
Purpose: Lets you set the field width dynamically by passing it as an argument.
Example:
printf("%*d\n", 5, 10);
// Output: "   10" (padded with spaces to width 5)
ðŸ§  Quick Summary
Pointer declaration: int *ptr; â†’ "ptr is a pointer to int".
Dereference: *ptr â†’ "value at the address stored in ptr".
Multiplication: a * b â†’ normal arithmetic multiplication.
Comments: /* ... */ â†’ ignored by compiler.
printf: "%*d" â†’ width is given as argument.
Visualizing Pointers (Bonus)
int x = 42;     // a normal integer variable
int *ptr = &x;  // ptr holds the address of x

// Diagram:
//  x   â†’ [42]
//  ptr â†’ [&x] â†’ points to x

printf("%d\n", *ptr); // shows 42
